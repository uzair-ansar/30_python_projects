Code Explanation: Sentiment Analysis Bot

-------------------------------------
Library used: TextBlob and dataclass
-------------------------------------
TextBlob: A library for processing textual data, providing a simple API for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
dataclass: A decorator that automatically generates special methods such as __init__() and __repr__() for a class. It simplifies the creation of classes that primarily store data.
Defining a Data Class for Mood

@dataclass
class Mood:
    emoji: str
    sentiment: float
@dataclass: A decorator that automatically adds special methods to the class based on its annotated attributes. Here, it creates a Mood class with two attributes: emoji and sentiment.
Defining the get_mood Function

def get_mood(input_text: str, *, sensitivity: float) -> Mood:
    """
    Analyze the mood of a given text and return a Mood object containing the emoji and sentiment polarity.

    :param input_text: The input text to be analyzed
    :param sensitivity: 0.0 (super sensitive) - 1.0 (ultra nonsensitive)
    :return: A Mood object containing the emoji representing the mood and the sentiment polarity value
    """
get_mood is a function that takes a text (input_text) and a sensitivity parameter. It returns a Mood object containing an emoji and a sentiment polarity value.
The sensitivity parameter controls the threshold for categorizing the sentiment.
Analyzing Sentiment Using TextBlob

    polarity: float = TextBlob(input_text).sentiment.polarity

TextBlob(input_text): Creates a TextBlob object for the given input text.
.sentiment.polarity: Calculates the sentiment polarity of the text using TextBlob.
Determining Mood

    # Define mood thresholds
    friendly_threshold: float = sensitivity
  hostile_threshold: float = -sensitivity

Sets threshold values for categorizing sentiments.

    # Determine the mood and return the corresponding emoji
    if polarity >= friendly_threshold:
        return Mood('😊', polarity)
    elif polarity <= hostile_threshold:
        return Mood('😠', polarity)
    else:
        return Mood('😐', polarity)


Uses the sentiment polarity to determine the mood.
If the polarity is greater than or equal to the friendly threshold, it returns a happy emoji ('😊').
If the polarity is less than or equal to the hostile threshold, it returns an angry emoji ('😠').
Otherwise, it returns a neutral emoji ('😐').
run_bot Function

def run_bot():
    print('Bot: Enter some text and I will perform a sentiment analysis on it.')
    while True:
        user_input: str = input('You: ')  # Try it with emojis as well! :) :O :D :( :I
        mood: Mood = get_mood(user_input, sensitivity=0.3)
        print(f'Bot: {mood.emoji} ({mood.sentiment})')
run_bot is a function that continuously takes user input, performs sentiment analysis, and outputs the result.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_bot()

The script runs the run_bot function when executed directly.

This script creates a simple sentiment analysis bot using TextBlob. The bot analyzes user input and categorizes it as happy, angry, or neutral, displaying an emoji and sentiment polarity. The sensitivity parameter controls the threshold for sentiment categorization. The script runs indefinitely, allowing users to interact with the sentiment analysis bot.




Other Doubts:

Polarity:

Definition: Polarity refers to the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. It indicates whether the text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
Scale: Polarity values are often represented on a numerical scale, commonly ranging from -1 to 1. Negative Polarity: Values closer to -1 indicate a more negative sentiment.
2. Positive Polarity: Values closer to 1 indicate a more positive sentiment.
3. Neutral Polarity: A polarity value around 0 indicates a neutral sentiment.
Example:
"I love this product!" → Positive Polarity
"I hate waiting in long lines." → Negative Polarity
"The weather is okay." → Neutral Polarity


Subjectivity:

Definition: Subjectivity measures the degree to which a piece of text expresses opinions, feelings, or personal perspectives rather than presenting factual information.
Scale: Subjectivity is often represented on a numerical scale, commonly ranging from 0 to 1.
1. High Subjectivity: Values closer to 1 indicate that the text is subjective, expressing opinions or emotions.
2. Low Subjectivity: Values closer to 0 indicate that the text is objective, presenting factual information without personal bias.
Example:
"I think the movie was amazing!" → High Subjectivity
"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius." → Low Subjectivity

TextBlob Python Library:TextBlob is a Python library built on top of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Pattern libraries for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.


Asterisk in get_mood function: In the get_mood function, the asterisk * is used in the parameter list to indicate that all the parameters following it must be specified as keyword arguments. [[The * indicates the end of positional parameters and the beginning of keyword-only parameters.]]
